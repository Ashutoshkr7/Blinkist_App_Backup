##About the project
This application follows [https://andela.com/insights/structuring-your-react-application-atomic-design-principles/](Atomic Design structure). The main purpose of making this application was to learn react. I faced some difficulties while testing the component change, with on click event, which lead to change of state. Otherwise it was a great learning project.
